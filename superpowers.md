Step 2: Use the "superpowers" commands 
Brainstorm: Before starting a complex task, use /superpowers:brainstorm to generate ideas and a high-level approach.
Write a plan: Once you have a basic idea, use /superpowers:write-plan to get a more detailed, step-by-step implementation plan.
Execute the plan: After reviewing the plan, use /superpowers:execute-plan to have Claude start executing the steps in batches.
